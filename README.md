This is a very basic [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/) app.

## Getting Started

First, run the development servers:

- Start the `ReScript` compiler

```bash
pnpm res:dev
```

- Start the `Next.js` app

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
